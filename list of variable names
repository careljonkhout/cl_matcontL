list of variable names in matcont
tvals = test function values
cds   = curve description structure
lds   = limitcycle description structure
eds   = equilibrium point description structure

                  
fields of cds:

cds.h          = stepsize         (may change every step)
cds.h_max      = maximum stepsize (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.h_min      = minimum stepsize (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.h_inc_fac  = stepsize increase factor (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.h_dec_fac  = stepsize decrease factor (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.SingLabels = labels for singlarities, ( for instance 'LP', 'H' )
cds.S          = Singularity matrix. Defines which testfunction changes correspond to which singularities

fields of lds:

LimitCycle/limitcycleL.m:56:    
lds.upoldp(:,i) = T*feval(lds.func, 0, lds.ups(:,i), p1{:});
lds.ups    = reshape(x,lds.nphase,lds.tps);
lds.vps    = reshape(v,lds.nphase,lds.tps);
lds.tps    = lds.ntst*lds.ncol+1; % number of points on curve
lds.cols_p1 = 1:(lds.ncol+1);
lds.cols_p1_coords = 1:(lds.ncol+1)*lds.nphase;

the following fiels of lds are constant throughout a continuation.
see function WorkspaceInit in limitcycleL.m

lds.ncol_coord = lds.ncol*lds.nphase;
lds.col_coords = 1:lds.ncol*lds.nphase;
lds.coords = 1:lds.ncoords;
lds.pars = lds.ncoords+(1:2); % indices of period and parameter
lds.tsts = 1:lds.ntst;
lds.cols = 1:lds.ncol;
lds.phases = 1:lds.nphase;
lds.ntstcol = lds.ntst*lds.ncol;



fields of currpoint and trialpoint in contL.m

x     = continuation state vector, i.e. current values of coordinates and parameters
v     = continuation tangent vector, entries correspond to x
iters = number of iterations spent in Newton corrections
R     = residual, i.e. value of curve function after Newton corrections
tvals = values of test functions
uvals = values of user functions
h     = stepsize
