field of cds:

cds.h      = stepsize         (may change every step)
cds.h_max  = maximum stepsize (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.h_min  = minimum stepsize (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.h_inc_fac = stepsize increase factor (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.h_dec_fac = stepsize decrease factor (does not change, is copied from contopts)
cds.SingLabels = labels for singlarities, ( for instance 'LP', 'H' )
cds.S          = Singularity matrix. Defines which testfunction changes correspond to which singularities

fields of currpoint and trialpoint in contL.m

x = continuation state vector, i.e. current values of coordinates and parameters
v = continuation tangent vector, entries correspond to x
iters = number of iterations spent in Newton corrections
R = residual, i.e. value of curve function after Newton corrections
