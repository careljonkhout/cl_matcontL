== Documentation for the System File Generator ==

The class System_of_ODEs can be used to process a system of equations so that it can be analyzed with cl_matcontL. The output of System_of_ODEs is a matcont system file.

To generate a matcont system file, start the GUI with the command.

SystemsGUI.new
  
or if you want the use the command line interface execute the commands:

s = System_of_ODEs.new(<name>, <variables_str>, <parameters_str>, <time>, <maxOrder>, <rhs>)
s.generate_file
 
where <name> is the name of the system, which will be used for the filename. The matcont file generated represents the first order system of ODEs

dx/dt = f(t,x,a)

where f is a function from R^n to R^n and where n is the length of x

- f is specified by the variable rhs
- rhs should be supplied as an n by 1 string array, a 1 by n string array or an n by m char array, where m is the length of the longest element of rhs. 
- The elements of f should be valid matlab expressions, using only variables and parameters specified in variables_str and parameters_str.
- The n-th element of rhs represents the n-th element of f(x,a). THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE MATCONT SYSTEM EDITOR
- x is specified by the variable variables_str.
- a is specified by the variable parameters_str.
- variables_str and parameters_str should be supplied as a char array or a string, such that the variables/parameters are separated by spaces and/or comma's.
- the symbol that represents t in dx/dt = f(t,x,a) is specified by the variable time.


== Using CVODES ==

System_of_ODEs can also generate a C program that can do time integration of the system using CVODES in the form of a mex file. Using the CVODES time integrator improves speed by a factor of four (approximately). This mexfile-C-program can be generated by passing the char array 'cvode' as the optional sixth argument to System_of_ODEs.new.

The CVODES integrates also performs the sensitivity analysis needed to compute the monodromy matrix in cycle continuation using the shooting methods.

== Technical details of mex interface of CVODES integrator ==

System_of_ODEs can be used to generate a CVODES integrator program for a specific system of ODEs. System_of_ODEs generates c-code for the right hand side of the System of ODEs, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs, and the right hand side of the system of ODEs that is used to compute the sensitivity.

== Advantage of generating C functions that define the system of ODEs ==

By generating the C-code instead of linking CVODES to matlab functions that define the system of ODEs saves a lot of costly overhead, since, as for as I know, if a Matlab function returns a newly computed result, it must be stored in a freshly allocated chunk of memory. In C we can reuse memory. Thus we can using functions written in C, we can significantly reduce the number of memory allocations.



Note that cl_matcontL was tested only on matlab 2019a
