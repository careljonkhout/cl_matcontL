Orthogonal Collocation
  - adding a field to lds is very likely to cause crashes, due to the way 
    fields are read form the lds structure in the mex files. It would be nice to 
    fix this.

Newton Picard
 
 - implement starting form hopf
 - better subspace continuation/computation. Use trivial eigenvalue/eigenvector pair
 

All cycles:

- reuse the Jacobian (in ortho col case) or subspace computation (in newt pic case)
  that is computed to compute the tangent vector to compute the multipliers
  (instead of recomputing)



see also todo comments in the code. use "find files" in matlab 
or rgrep in linux/cygwin to find them quickly.
