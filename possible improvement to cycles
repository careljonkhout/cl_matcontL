- optimize shooting points selection
- start form hopf
- implement a check, for single shooting:
  - is has happened to me that a single shooting continuation steps onto a 
    equilibrium. To prevent this, there is a certain check that can be made:
     f(0,phases_0,parameter) >= treshold

- adapt size of small subspace


orthogonal collocation
  - adding a field to lds is very likely to cause crashes, due to the way 
    fields are read form the lds structure in the mex files. It would be nice to 
    fix this.
