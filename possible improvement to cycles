Orthogonal Collocation
  - adding a field to lds is very likely crashes or unexpected behaviour, due to 
    the way fields are read form the lds structure in the mex files. It would be 
    nice to fix this.

Newton Picard
 
 - implement starting form hopf for multiple shooting
 - better subspace continuation/computation. 
   Use trivial eigenvalue/eigenvector pair.

All cycles:

- reuse the Jacobian (in ortho col case) or subspace computation (in newt pic case)
  that is computed to compute the tangent vector to compute the multipliers
  (instead of recomputing)

- check if correct curvefile is supplied to contL or start contL directly form 
  initializer

- time spent in bisection is reported incorrectly



see also todo comments in the code. use "find files" in matlab 
or rgrep in linux/cygwin to find them quickly.
