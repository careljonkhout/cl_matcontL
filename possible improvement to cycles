Orthogonal Collocation
  - adding a field to lds is very likely crashes or unexpected behaviour, due to 
    the way fields are read form the lds structure in the mex files. It would be 
    nice to fix this.

Newton Picard

 - implement branch switching at branching points of cycles.
 - better subspace continuation/computation. 
   Use trivial eigenvalue/eigenvector pair.
 - reuse the subspace computation 
   that is computed to compute the tangent vector to compute the multipliers
   (instead of recomputing)


All cycles:

- time spent in bisection is sometimes reported incorrectly
