Orthogonal Collocation
  - adding a field to lds is very likely to cause crashes, due to the way 
    fields are read form the lds structure in the mex files. It would be nice to 
    fix this.

  
 
Newton Picard
 
 - test to see if nDiscretizationPoints can be removed (I think it can be removed)
 - compute tangent vector at every step, instead of using secant vector.
 - implement starting form hopf
 - better subspace continuation/computation. Use trivial eigenvalue/eigenvector pair
 

All cycles:

- create separate test functions for locating and detection of bifurcations.
  This prevent the detection of neutral saddles, which are irrelevant.

- reuse the Jacobian (in ortho col case) or subspace computation (in newt pic case)
  that is computed to compute the tangent vector to compute the multipliers
  (instead of recomputing)

- BPC detection could be added by checking if a multiplier crossed the unit 
  at one, and excluding the LPC case.

- I have observed that the continuer does not detect a singlarity if a singularity
  was detected in the previous step.
