Orthogonal Collocation
  - adding a field to lds is very likely crashes or unexpected behaviour, due to 
    the way fields are read form the lds structure in the mex files. It would be 
    nice to fix this.
  - a linear solver tailored to the sparsity of the the Jacobian of cycle continuation 
    by orthogonal collocation could be faster and use less memory. Auto already has
    this. For his master thesis Mestrom tried this and the results were disappointing.
    However, for large enough systems a custom solver should perform better, because
    the default linear solver does not seem to exploit the sparsity 
    structure very well for very large systems, leading to much unecessary fill in.
Newton Picard
 
 - implement starting form hopf for multiple shooting
 - implement branch switching at branching points of cycles.
 - better subspace continuation/computation. 
   Use trivial eigenvalue/eigenvector pair.
 - reuse the subspace computation 
   that is computed to compute the tangent vector to compute the multipliers
   (instead of recomputing)


All cycles:


- check if correct curvefile is supplied to contL or start contL directly form 
  initializer

- time spent in bisection is sometimes reported incorrectly

or rgrep in linux/cygwin to find them quickly.
