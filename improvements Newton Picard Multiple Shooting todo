- optimize shooting points selection
- start form hopf
- implement a check, for single shooting:
  - is has happened to me that a single shooting continuation steps onto a 
    equilibrium. To prevent this, there is a certain check that can be made:
     f(0,phases_0,parameter) >= treshold

- adapt size of small subspace
