%%function mat4bvp(bvp4c)
function mat4bvp(bvp5c)
%MAT4BVP  Find the fourth eigenvalue of the Mathieu's equation.
%   Find the fourth eigenvalue of Mathieu's equation
%
%      y'' + (lambda - 2*q*cos(2*x))*y = 0
%
%   on the interval [0, pi] with boundary conditions y'(0) = 0, y'(pi) = 0
%   when the parameter q = 5.
%
%   Special codes for Sturm-Liouville problems can compute specific
%   eigenvalues. The general-purpose code BVP4C can only compute an
%   eigenvalue near to a guessed value. We can make it much more likely that
%   we compute the eigenfunction corresponding to the fourth eigenvalue by
%   supplying a guess that has the correct qualitative behavior.
%   The eigenfunction y(x) is determined only to a constant multiple, so the
%   normalizing condition y(0) = 1 is used to specify a particular solution.
%
%   Plotting the solution on the mesh found by BVP4C does not result in a
%   smooth graph. The solution S(x) is continuous and has a continuous
%   derivative. It can be evaluated inexpensively using DEVAL at as many
%   points as necessary to get a smooth graph.
%
%   By default, this example uses the BVP4C solver. Use syntax
%   MAT4BVP('bvp5c') to solve this problem with the BVP5C solver.
