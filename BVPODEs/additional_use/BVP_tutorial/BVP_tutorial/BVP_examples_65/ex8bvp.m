function ex8bvp
%EX8BVP  Example 8 of the BVP tutorial.
%   These are equations describing fluid injection through one side of
%   a long  vertical channel, considered in Example 1.4 of U.M. Ascher, 
%   R.M.M. Mattheij, and R.D. Russell, Numerical Solution of Boundary 
%   Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations, SIAM, 1995
%
%   The differential equations
%
%      f''' - R*[(f')^2 - f*f''] + R*A = 0
%      h'' + R*f*h' + 1 = 0
%      theta'' + P*f*theta' = 0
%
%   are to be solved subject to boundary conditions
%
%      f(0) = f'(0) = 0
%      f(1) = 1
%      f'(1) = 0
%      h(0) = h(1) = 0
%      theta(0) = 0
%      theta(1) = 1
%
%   Here R and P are known constants, but A is determined by the boundary 
%   conditions.
%
%   For a Reynolds number R = 100, this problem can be solved with crude
%   guesses, but as R increases, it becomes much more difficult because of
%   a boundary layer at x = 0.  The solution is computed here for R = 10000
%   by continuation, i.e., the solution for one value of R is used as guess
%   for R = R*10.  This is a comparatively expensive problem for BVP4C because
%   a fine mesh is needed to resolve the boundary layer and there are 7 
%   unknown functions and 1 unknown parameter.


% The solution is first sought for R = 100.
R = 100;

options = [];    % place holder

% A crude mesh of 10 equally spaced points and a constant 1 
% for each solution component is used for the first value of R.
% The unknown parameter A is guessed to be 1.
