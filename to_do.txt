The use of the global structs cds eds, and lds in cl_matcontL, is contrary to 
good coding practices. These structres are problematic, because their contents
can affect any part of the program, and the purpose and intended contents of 
the fields of these structes are poorly documented. However, removing them 
alltogether, requires a lot of work. A good start towards improving the quality 
of the cl_matcontL code, is to document all the fields of cds lds, and eds.
