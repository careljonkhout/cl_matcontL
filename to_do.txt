The use of the global structs cds eds, and lds in cl_matcontL, is contrary to 
good coding practices. These structres are problematic, because their contents
can affect any part of the program, and the purpose and intended contents of 
the fields of these structes are poorly documented. However, removing them 
alltogether, requires a lot of work. A good start towards improving the quality 
of the cl_matcontL code, is to document all the fields of cds lds, and eds.

- in run_all_demos, run slow demos last

- set filename explicitly in scripts

- store ode parameter values in each point in single_shooting

- remove and print before every point data header i.e.
             :  p(2)              period           point norm       curve func norm  step size
 when log level is greater than 0

- replace initial point for extend demo's so that they start close to the same point as the other demos

- print parameters in extend demo's

- adjust and deprioritize mv_count message

- create list of print_diag messages and sort according to priority
