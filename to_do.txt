
minimize the use of global variables

The use of the global structs cds eds, and lds in cl_matcontL, is contrary to 
good coding practices. These structres are problematic, because their contents
can affect any part of the program, and the purpose and intended contents of 
the fields of these structes are poorly documented. However, removing them 
alltogether, requires a lot of work. A good start towards improving the quality 
of the cl_matcontL code, is to document all the fields of cds lds, and eds, and
to write a comprehensive test suite for cl_matcontL that can verify as much of 
the code as possible, within a very short amount of time (i.e. one minute)
 by running a single command. Once a comprehensive test suite is present, 
rewriting cl_matcontL to remove global structs should become much safer
, and easier.

When the global structs are replaced, they should be replaced by classes. 
By adding comments to the property declarations of the class, the fields can 
be properly documented.

Also, any effort to replace global variables with classes, should be coordinated
with the Matcont project.
